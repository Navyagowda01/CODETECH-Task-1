Overview of the Project:

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) 
based on user input. It serves as a basic demonstration of how user inputs can be handled, operations can be performed, and results can be displayed in Python.

Key Activities:
1. Defining Arithmetic Functions: Create functions for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition (add), subtraction (subtract), multiplication (multiply), and division (divide).
Ensure that the division function handles the special case of division by zero by returning an error message.
2. User Input Handling: Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Add error handling for invalid inputs (non-numeric values) to ensure the program continues to run smoothly without crashing.
3.Operation Selection: Present the user with a menu of operations to choose from (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Take user input for the desired operation.
4. Performing Calculations: Based on the operation selected by the user, call the corresponding function and perform the required arithmetic operation.
Display the result of the operation in a user-friendly format.
5. Error Handling: Ensure the program handles cases where the user selects an invalid operation or enters invalid numbers.
6. Program Execution: Execute the program as a standalone script that runs the calculator() function, where the entire interaction with the user takes place.

   
Technology Used:
1. Programming Language: Python
  The calculator is developed using Python due to its simplicity and ease of handling user inputs, functions, and error handling.
2. Core Concepts Used: 
    * Functions: To define the operations and encapsulate logic for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    * Input/Output: To interact with the user and display results.
    * Error Handling: Using try-except blocks to ensure proper handling of invalid user input.
3. Data Types:
    * Floats: To handle decimal numbers, as the calculator is designed to work with both integer and floating-point numbers.
     * Strings: For user input and operation selection.
       
This basic calculator program is a simple example, perfect for demonstrating basic Python concepts like functions, user input, and control flow.
